# WACLaTeX
A collection of LaTeX templates for use in WACL and beyond.

Try to bunch together related templates with an appropriate prefix (e.g., everything to do with publications being "pubs_").

Currently in the repository:

* `demo`: A demo document that serves as an introduction to preparing a basic report in LaTeX.

* `pubs_letter-to-editor`: A template for the cover letter for a paper.

* `pubs_response-to-reviewers`: A template for responses to reviewers, especially useful if you've written the paper itself in LaTeX. Set up to format responses in an attractive way, and allow for cross-referencing between responses.
