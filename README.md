# Useful LaTeX resources for use in WACL

## Contents

Currently in the repository:

* `demo` - A demo document that serves as an introduction to preparing a basic report in LaTeX.

* `pubs_letter-to-editor` - A template for the cover letter for a paper.

* `pubs_response-to-reviewers` - A template for responses to reviewers, especially useful if you've written the paper itself in LaTeX. Set up to format responses in an attractive way, and allow for cross-referencing between responses.

* `thesis` - A PhD/Masters thesis template, set up with a sensible structure and including everything required by the University of York as of December 2021.

## Using this Repo

Try to bunch together related templates with an appropriate prefix (e.g., everything to do with publications beginning `pubs_`).

If you aren't a GitHub user (you should consider it!) you can click the green "code" button and then "download ZIP" to download the templates to your computer.

The [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) platform is an excellent resource to start using and collaborating with LaTeX.

If you are a new LaTeX user, please do ask for help. There are plenty of people in WACL with enough experience to get you started.
