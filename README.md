# Useful LaTeX resources for use in WACL

## Contents

Currently in the repository:

* `demo` - A demo document that serves as an introduction to preparing a basic report in LaTeX.

* `pubs_letter-to-editor` - A template for the cover letter for a paper.

* `pubs_response-to-reviewers` - A template for responses to reviewers, especially useful if you've written the paper itself in LaTeX. Set up to format responses in an attractive way, and allow for cross-referencing between responses.

* `thesis` - A PhD/Masters thesis template, set up with a sensible structure and including everything required by the University of York as of December 2021.

* `report_tap` - An example TAP report structure for PhD students.

## Using this Repo

* If you have a nice LaTeX template, please contribute it! There's no reason every single person needs to write their own thesis/TAP report/letter/etc. template.

* If you have a different version of something that's already here (a differently formatted thesis, for example) please still contribute - choice is no bad thing.

* Try to bunch together related templates with an appropriate prefix (e.g., everything to do with publications beginning `pubs_`).

* If you aren't a GitHub user (you should consider it!) you can click the green "code" button and then "download ZIP" to download the templates to your computer.

## New LaTeX Users

* The [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) platform is an excellent resource to start using and collaborating with LaTeX.

* If you are a new LaTeX user, please do ask for help. There are plenty of people in WACL with enough experience to get you started.
